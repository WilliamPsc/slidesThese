                    \item Vulnerability assessment of a DIFT mechanism against FIA.
                    \item Open-Source tool to help find vulnerabilities during the conceptual phase.
                    % \item Taking into account multiple complex fault models.
                    \item Proposition of 3 lightweight countermeasures with a low overhead of area and performances.
                \end{itemize}

    \note{
        \textit{Vulnerability assessment:} taking into account different fault models up to very complex ones

        \textit{FISSA:} Security by Design

        \textit{Countermeasures:} good efficiency, overhead is minimal compared to others countermeasures like BCH, spatial redundancy (duplication, triplication)

\subsection{Perspectives}
\begin{frame}{Perspectives}
    \begin{block}{Short terms}
        \begin{itemize}
            \setbeamertemplate{itemize items}[triangle]
            \item Propose more robust countermeasures to correct multiple faults
            \item Further development of FISSA
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Long terms}
        \begin{itemize}
            \setbeamertemplate{itemize items}[triangle]
            \item Conduct real-world FIA
            \item Extend the assessment of more complex DIFT
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \end{figure}

    \note{
        \textit{FISSA:} better integration in the design workflow, more fault models, more configurability (to find targets automatically)
        
        \textit{Actual FIA:} using chip whisperer for clock, chip shouter for EMFI
